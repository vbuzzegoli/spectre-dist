## What is Spectre

_Spectre_ is a software that allows you to **create desktop applications for any web applications**, on Mac OSX. :fire:

## Installation

![spectre](spectre.png)

- **[DOWNLOAD APPLICATION HERE](https://github.com/vbuzzegoli/spectre-dist/raw/master/Spectre.zip)** _- v1.1.0-beta_
- Unzip the compressed file by double-clicking on it
- Move the newly uncompressed `Spectre.app` to your _Applications_ folder
- **Important: You may need to authorize Spectre.** Double-click on the app to open it, the application will likely be blocked as is a third party application. Once blocked, open `System Preferences`, click on `Security & Privacy` (`General` tab), and click on `Open Anyway`. You will not have to repeat these steps anymore.

That's it. :raised_hands:

You can now **make any web application and desktop application**.

## Examples

Here is a list of amazing web apps that could use a desktop application, to get you started. **These frequently used web apps are already preset for you within _Spectre_**, so you can generate them right away without looking for links.
